# My Portfolio

## Description

This is the bare bones of my personal portfolio. I will continue adjusting and adding things to this as I progress and learn. 

## Usage

As of this moment, the functionality is limited. I will add projects to the work section as I complete them. The links in the header are anchored to their respective sections in the page and will scroll when clicked.
